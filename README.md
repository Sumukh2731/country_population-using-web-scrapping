# country_population-using-web-scrapping

1. **Introduction and Setup**:
   - The notebook begins with necessary import statements, including libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.

2. **Web Scraping**:
   - It demonstrates how to perform web scraping using the `requests` library to fetch HTML content from a webpage.
   - The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse the HTML content and extract specific data.

3. **Data Extraction**:
   - A table of country populations is extracted from a webpage. The data includes fields such as Country, Population, Yearly Change, Net Change, Density, Land Area, Migrants, Fertility Rate, Median Age, Urban Population, and World Share.

4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - The extracted data is cleaned and transformed into a structured format using pandas.
   - The notebook shows how to handle missing data and convert data types to appropriate formats.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - The cleaned data is analyzed to generate insights. For example, it computes summary statistics and visualizes the data.

6. **Creating a CSV File**:
   - Finally, the cleaned and analyzed data is saved into a CSV file named `country_population.csv`.
